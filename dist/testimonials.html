Ian completely designed and developed his first impressions into what can only be described as a stunning array of innovative ideas. He was meticulous in his planning and open to ideas from Gill and I in reaching the finished design. We love this garden and Ian made sure it turned out to be every bit and more of what we had dreamed of. Ian’s attention to detail made the final finishing spectacular and our photos show testament to this. Thanks again Ian 5*****."</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/kitchen/goldsmith-kitchen-6.jpg" alt="JOHN GOLDSMITH"> <h5>JOHN GOLDSMITH</h5> <p>"Excellent kitchen and dining room transformation. Ian's work ethic is second to none and nothing is too much trouble for him. A fantastic job.We are both very pleased and would highly recommend Pink Gorilla to anyone."</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/interior/collingwood-flooring.jpg" alt="MALCOLM COLLINGWOOD"> <h5>MALCOLM COLLINGWOOD</h5> <p>"I can highly recommend the high quality of workmanship provided. Laying the wood floor in the hallway, lounge and dining room was a big task, however it was carried out in a very efficient and worklike way. Also fitting a new shower and tiling both, walls and floor in the bathroom were done in the same manner."</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/kitchen/russell-kitchen-3.jpg" alt="JULIE RUSSELL"> <h5>JULIE RUSSELL</h5> <p>"Absolutely delighted with our beautiful new kitchen fitted by Ian. The quality of Ian's work is first class. We cannot praise him enough, his attention to detail is superb. Customer service at its very best, nothing at all is too much trouble. I would highly recommend Pink Gorilla to anyone"</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/kitchen/hunter-kitchen-2.jpg" alt="TASMIN HUNTER"> <h5>TASMIN HUNTER</h5> <p>"Thanks Ian,my new kitchen has totally exceeded my expectations.Even after a few weeks as I walk into it I can’t believe it’s really mine,my dream kitchen. You put blood,sweat and (probably) tears into it but you did it! The quality and workmanship is second to none...Thank You!"</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/kitchen/goldsmith-kitchen-4.jpg" alt="SUE GOLDSMITH"> <h5>SUE GOLDSMITH</h5> <p>"Unbelievable transformation of our old tired kitchen into a modern kitchen/dining room. Thank you so much Ian for all your hard work. You've done a brilliant job!!"</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/garden/exley.jpg" alt="STU EXLEY"> <h5>STU EXLEY</h5> <p>"I had added a new extension to my house and needed to replace the old decking, which was not fit for purpose. Ian assisted with the design and layout and we worked together in the construction of two separate decking areas, a pergola and a boardwalk which links the two. The result is fabulous and provides a wraparound to the extension, bringing inside/outside living to both the rear and side gardens. Ian's attention to detail has ensured a top notch finish."</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/garden/lumsdon.jpg" alt="IAN & HELEN LUMSDON"> <h5>IAN & HELEN LUMSDON</h5> <p>"The service that we got from Ian was fantastic. He listened to what we wanted and came up with some unique ideas and designs. The quality of workmanship was second to none due to his care and attention to detail. We would certainly recommend Ian to others and wouldn't have any concerns about using him again. A great job, well done."</p> </li> <li> <img src="assets/img/gallery/kitchen/hindle.jpg" alt="CHRIS HINDLE"> <h5>CHRIS HINDLE</h5> <p>"Highly recommended. Work done to excellent standard.
